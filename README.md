## [!Big Data Project: Film recommendation engine using the IMDb 5000 dataset] (https://github.com/SanyTiger/film_recommendation_engine/blob/master/FinalFilmRecommendationEngineCode-BigData.ipynb)

This project aims at recommending movies, TV shows based on user's preference of the previous movies and TV shows. We use the IMDb 5000 dataset having movies.csv and credits.csv dataset files. Basically the user would select a movie and based on that movie alone the recommendation engine would suggest 5 movies that the user may prefer. The selection, of course, is based on three categories

> popularity-based engine - The most impersonal recommendation engine as it doesn't consider the user's preference.


> content-based engine - Recommends other movies based on the description of the current movie.


>collaborative-based engine - Recommends movies based on other users' choice whose previous list of movies included the user's current movie.
